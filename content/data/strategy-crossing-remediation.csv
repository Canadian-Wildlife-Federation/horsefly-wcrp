1.1,Rehabilitate crossings that are acting as barriers,"This intervention includes some projects that would be led by the planning team with conservation funds (e.g., orphaned barriers or those owned by individuals), while other rehabilitation projects would be the responsibility of the barrier owner. Industry will have to be engaged to successfully implement this intervention. HRR can help with finding local people to implement rehabilitation projects.

1.2,Lobby the government to enforce their regulations,"This can apply to both provincial and federal governments. For example, advocating for increased discretionary decisions to remove barriers to fish.

1.3,Initiate a barrier owner outreach program for locations on the barrier rehabilitation shortlist,"Work with landowners / users (e.g., ATV groups) to identify and rehabilitate their aquatic barriers. Education component can help prevent barriers from being installed in the first place. HRR to reach out to owners of confirmed barriers to discuss rehabilitation options; CWF to reach out to provincial representatives.",Very high,Very high,Very effective

1.5,Knowledge Gap: conduct field assessments on updated preliminary barrier list using the provincial fish passage framework and update connectivity goal if additional barriers are added to the barrier rehabilitation shortlist,,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.6,Update longitudinal connectivity goal if additional barriers are added to the barrier rehabilitation shortlist,,,,
1.7,Knowledge Gap: Identify and map crossing ownership,For barriers on the barrier rehabilitation shortlist.,Very high,Very high,Very effective
1.8,Knowledge Gap: Compile road maintenance schedules,"Ground-truthing is important, as the schedules do not always reflect what happens in the field.",High,High,Effective
