    "text": "Acknowledgements\nThis plan is the culmination of a collaborative planning process undertaken in the Horsefly River watershed over many months with a team of individuals and groups that are passionate about the conservation and restoration of freshwater ecosystems and the species they support. Plan development was funded by the B.C. Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund, Canada Nature Fund for Aquatic Species at Risk, and the RBC Bluewater Project.\nWe were fortunate to benefit from the feedback, guidance, and wisdom of many people who volunteered their time throughout this process — this publication would not have been possible without the engagement of our partners and the planning team (see Table 1). We recognize the incredible fish passage and connectivity work that has occurred in the Horsefly River watershed to-date, and we are excited to continue partnering with local groups and organizations to build upon existing initiatives and provide a road map to push connectivity restoration forward over the next 20 years and beyond.\nThe Canadian Wildlife Federation recognizes that the lands and waters that form the basis of this plan are the traditional unceded territory of the Northern Secwepemc people. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from the stewards of this land and work together to benefit Pacific Salmon. A special thank you to Nishitha Singi for sharing the traditional Secwepemctsín names used in this plan."

    "text": "Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort, the overall aim of which is to build collaborative partnerships within the Horsefly River watershed to improve connectivity for anadromous salmon and the livelihoods that they support, including the continued sustenance, cultural, and ceremonial needs of the Northern Secwépemc people. This 20-year plan was developed to identify priority actions that the Horsefly River WCRP planning team (see Table 1 for a list of team members) will undertake between 2021-2040 to conserve and restore fish passage through barrier rehabilitation and prevention strategies.\nWCRPs are long-term, actionable plans that blend local stakeholder and rightsholder knowledge with innovative geographic information systems (GIS) analyses to gain a shared understanding of where restoration efforts will have the greatest benefit for anadromous salmon. The planning process is inspired by the Conservation Standards (v.4.0), which is a conservation planning framework that allows planning teams to systematically identify, implement, and monitor strategies to apply the most effective solutions to high-priority conservation problems. There is a rich history of fish habitat planning and restoration work in the Horsefly River watershed that this WCRP builds upon, including work undertaken by the B.C. Fish Passage Technical Working Group, the Northern Secwepemc te Qelmucw (NStQ) and member communities, the Horsefly River Roundtable, and other local organizations (Ltd. (2018); S. Hocquard, Steve Hocquard Consulting, pers. comm.).\nThe planning team compiled existing structure location and assessment data, habitat data, and previously identified priorities, and combined this with local and Indigenous knowledge to create a strategic watershed-scale plan to improve connectivity. The Horsefly River WCRP planning team applied the WCRP planning framework to define the “thematic” scope of freshwater connectivity and refine the “geographic” scope to identify only those portions of the watershed where structure prioritization will be conducted, and subsequent restoration efforts will take place. Additionally, the team selected focal fish species, assess the current key habitat connectivity status of the watershed, defined concrete goals for gains in connectivity, and undertook an iterative structure-ranking process to identify a list of priority barriers for rehabilitation to achieve those goals. Although the current version of this plan is based on the best-available information at the time of publishing, WCRPs are intended to be “living plans” that are updated regularly as new information becomes available, or if local priorities and contexts change. As such, this document should be interpreted as a current “snap-shot” in time, and future iterations of this WCRP will build upon the material presented in this plan to continuously improve connectivity planning in the Horsefly River watershed. For more information on how WCRPs are developed, see Mazany-Wright, Noseworthy, et al. (2021)."

    "text": "Project Scope\nConnectivity influences critical components of freshwater ecosystem structure and function, such as aquatic species dispersal and migration, the transport of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation Seliger and Zeiringer (2018). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term “connectivity” is defined as the degree to which focal species can disperse or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, connectivity is primarily constrained by physical barriers, including human-made infrastructure such as dams, weirs, and stream crossings, and natural features such as waterfalls and debris flows. This plan is intended to focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers instead of the broad land-use patterns that are causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this WCRP is addressing barriers to both longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) and lateral connectivity (i.e., connectivity between the mainstem and adjacent riparian wetlands and floodplains) due to the importance of maintaining fish passage to spawning, rearing, and overwintering habitat in the watershed.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope — the Horsefly River watershed — located in the Fraser River system.\n\n\nThe primary geographic scope of this WCRP is the Horsefly River watershed, located in the upper Fraser River drainage basin in central British Columbia (Figure 1). The scope constitutes the Horsefly River “watershed group” as defined by the British Columbia Freshwater Atlas (FWA). A consistent spatial framework was necessary to undertake a watershed selection process at the provincial scale to identify target watersheds to improve connectivity for salmon. The Horsefly River watershed was identified by the B.C. Fish Passage Restoration Initiative as one of four target watersheds for WCRP development Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021b). The Horsefly River watershed has a drainage area of 276,603 ha, spanning from the Quesnel Highlands in the southeast to the confluence with Quesnel Lake in the northwest. Culturally and economically important populations of Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, and Sockeye Salmon are all found in the watershed, which historically supported Indigenous sustenance and trading economies (W. L. F. Nation. (2021), X. F. Nation. (2021)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Focal fish species in the Horsefly River watershed. The Secwepemctsín\nand Western common and scientific species names are provided. Secwepemctsín NameCommon NameScientific NameKekèsuChinook SalmonOncorhynchus tshawytschaSxeyqsCoho SalmonOncorhynchus kisutchSqlelten7ùwiSockeye SalmonOncorhynchus nerka\n\n\n\nThe Horsefly River watershed comprises parts of Secwepemcúl’ecw, the traditional territory of the Northern Secwepemc te Qelmucw (NStQ), represented by the Northern Shuswap Tribal Council and four member communities or autonomous nations:\n\nXatśūll Cmetem’ (Soda Creek First Nations)\nStswēceḿc Xgāt’tem (Canoe Creek/Dog Creek First Nations)\nT’ēxelc (Williams Lake First Nation)\nTsq’ēsceń (Canim Lake First Nation)\n\nThe geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying naturally accessible waterbodies, which are defined as waterbodies that focal species should be able to access in the absence of human-made barriers (Figure 2). Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using fish species observation and distribution data, as well as data on “natural barriers”. These include waterfalls greater than 5 m in height, gradient barriers based on literatrure-derived species-specific swimming abilities, and areas of subsurface flow. These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the constraints on naturally accessible waterbodies. The planning team identified certain tributaries to the mainstem Horsefly River as “watershed exclusion areas”, which were excluded from further consideration under this plan due to intermittent or insufficient flows to support restoring connectivity for the focal species. The geographic scope was further refined based on several confirmed impassable waterfalls and modelled gradient barriers. Specifically, there are two impassable waterfalls that severely limit natural accessibility: one on the mainstem Horsefly River approximately 4 km upstream of the confluence with McKinley Creek, and the second on Moffat Creek approximately 5 km upstream from where it flows into the Horsefly River. All waterbodies not identified as naturally accessible were removed from the scope for further consideration. The naturally accessible waterbodies formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling useable habitat types, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning Mazany-Wright, Norris, et al. (2021a).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Naturally accessible waterbodies within the Horsefly River watershed.

    "section": "Focal species",
    "text": "Focal species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being conserved or restored in the watershed. In the Horsefly River watershed, the planning team selected anadromous salmon as the focal guild, which comprises Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawystcha), Coho Salmon (O. kisutch), and Sockeye Salmon (O. nerka). The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by the focal species of the primary fund supporting this planning work.\n\nAnadromous Salmon\nAnadromous salmon are cultural and ecological keystone species that contribute to productive ecosystems by contributing marine-derived nutrients to the watershed and forming an important food source for other species. Salmon species are sacred to the NStQ, having sustained life, trading economies, and culture since time immemorial (W. L. F. Nation. (2021), X. F. Nation. (2021), N. Singi pers. comm.). The stewardship of the resources and fisheries in their traditional territories are imbued in the spirit of the NStQ through a symbiotic relationship based on respect – the NStQ never take more salmon than is needed and there is no waste. The entirety of the salmon is used - smoked and dried to sustain the NStQ through the winter months, the roe harvested for consumption, salmon oil rendered to be stored and traded, and the skin used to store the oil (Wilson, Twohig, and Dahlstrom (1998), X. F. Nation. (2021), N. Singi pers. comm.). The salmon runs begin to return to the Horsefly River watershed in early August, and the NStQ traditionally celebrate and feast at this time. The harvest of the salmon strengthens the cultural connection to the land and the waters, providing an important food source for communities and the opportunity to pass knowledge and ceremony to future generations through fishing and fish processing (W. L. F. Nation. (2021), X. F. Nation. (2021)).\nAnadromous salmon populations in the Horsefly River watershed have declined significantly in the past few decades, with the populations of all three focal species being listed as Threatened or Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife In Canada (COSEWIC). This has been exacerbated by the Big Bar landslide on the Fraser River in 2019, leading the four NStQ communities to voluntarily close the salmon fishery from 2019-2022. The stewardship of their waters continues through the work of the NStQ member communities and the Northern Shuswap Tribal Council.\n\n\nChinook Salmon | Kekèsu | Oncorhynchus tshawytscha\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Chinook Salmon population assessments in the Horsefly River\nwatershed.

Known spawning occurs in parts of the Horsefly River mainstem above the confluence with the Little Horsefly River and throughout McKinley Creek as far as Elbow Lake (DFO (1991), S. Hocquard, pers. comm.). Important rearing systems include Patenaude Creek, Kroener Creek, Black Creek, Woodjam Creek, Deerhorn Creek, and Wilmot Creek (S.

Spawning occurs in the Little Horsefly River between Gruhs Lake and Horsefly Lake, McKinley Creek below McKinley Lake, Woodjam Creek, Patenaude Creek, Tisdall Creek, and Black Creek.

Sockeye Salmon spawning is known to occur throughout the Horsefly River (up to the impassable falls), in the Little Horsefly River between Gruhs Lake and Horsefly Lake, Moffat Creek (up to the impassible falls), and McKinley Creek up to Elbow Lake (Pacific-Salmon-Foundation (2020), DFO (1991), S. Hocquard pers. comm.). Additionally, a spawning channel aimed at enhancing the Sockeye Salmon population was constructed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 1989 DFO (1991). Currently, there are no Sockeye Salmon rearing in the Horsefly River watershed – all emergent fry migrate down to Quesnel Lake."

    "section": "Structure Types",
    "text": "Structure Types\nThe following table highlights which structure types pose the greatest threat to anadromous salmon in the watershed. The results of this assessment were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there is little spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific barrier type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Structure Types in the Horsefly River watershed and structure rating assessment results. For each structure type listed, Extent refers to the proportion of anadromous salmonid habitat that is being blocked by that structure type, Severity is the proportion of structures for each structure type that are known to block passage for focal species based on field assessments, and Irreversibility is the degree to which the effects of a structure type can be reversed and connectivity restored. The amount of habitat blocked used in this exercise is a representation of total amount of combined spawning and rearing habitat.\n\n\nStructure Types\nExtent\nSeverity\nIrreversibility\nOverall Threat Rating:\n\n\n\n\nRoad-Stream Crossings\nLow\nVery High\nMedium\nVery High\n\n\nLateral Barriers\nHigh\nVery High\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\nSmall Dams(&lt;3m height)\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nMedium\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nLow\nLow\nMedium\nLow\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nMedium\nHigh\nLow\nLow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoad-stream Crossings\nRoad-stream crossings are the most abundant structure type in the watershed, with 243 assessed and modelled crossings located on waterbodies with upstream modelled habitat. Demographic road crossings (highways, municipal, and paved roads) block 10.24 km of habitat (~3% of the total blocked habitat), with 69% of assessed crossings having been identified as barriers to fish passage. Resource roads block 17.31 km of habitat (~5%), with 60% of assessed crossings having been identified as barriers. The planning team felt that the data were underestimating the severity of road-stream crossing structures in the watershed, and therefore decided to update the rating from High to Very High. The planning team also felt that an irreversibility rating of Medium was appropriate due to the technical complexity and resources required to rehabilitate road-stream crossings.\n\n\nLateral Barriers\nThere are numerous types of lateral barriers that potentially occur in the watershed, including dykes, berms, and linear development (i.e., road and rail lines), all of which can restrict the ability of anadromous salmon to move into floodplains, riparian wetlands, and other off-channel habitats. No comprehensive lateral barrier data exists within the watershed, so pressure ratings were based on qualitative local knowledge. Lateral barriers are not thought to be as prevalent as road- or rail-stream crossings but are likely very severe where they do exist. Significant lateral barriers are known to occur along the mainstem of the Horsefly River, which disconnect the mainstem river from historic floodplain and off-channel habitat. Overall, the planning team decided that a High pressure rating adequately captured the effect that lateral barriers are having on connectivity in the watershed. Work to begin quantifying and mapping lateral habitat commenced in 2022, as described in the Operational Plan (Table 2) under Strategy 2: Lateral barrier rehabilitation.\n\n\nSmall Dams (&lt;3 m height)\nInitially, 6 mapped small dams were identified in the watershed that had upstream modelled spawning or rearing habitat for key species. Field assessments were conducted in 2021 and 2022, and 5 of the mapped dams were identified as presenting no barrier to fish passage because they did not exist, were off channel, or had no suitable key habitat upstream (see Table 2). The remaining dam, at the outlet of McKinley Lake is equipped with a fishway that provides passage for salmon. The effectiveness of the fishway on the McKinley Lake dam is unknown, and further study to assess fish passage efficiency is recommended (see Table 3).\n\n\nTrail-stream Crossings\nThere is very little spatial data available on trail-stream crossings in the watershed, so the planning team was unable to quantify the true Extent and Severity of this structure type. However, the planning team felt that trail-stream crossings are not prevalent within the watershed and that, where they do exist, they do not significantly restrict passage for anadromous salmon. As most crossings will be fords or similar structures, rehabilitation may not be required, or rehabilitation costs associated with these structures would be quite low. Overall, the planning team felt that the pressure rating for trail-stream crossings was likely Low; however, the lack of ground-truthed evidence to support this rating was identified as a knowledge gap within this plan.\n\n\nNatural Barriers\nNatural barriers to fish passage can include debris flows, log jams, and sediment deposits, but natural features that have always restricted fish passage (e.g., waterfalls) are not considered under this barrier type. Natural barriers are difficult to include in a spatial prioritization framework due to their transient nature. The planning team identified known natural barriers that occur throughout the watershed, such as beaver dams and log jams. Generally, these natural barriers are only severe impediments to fish passage during low-flow years, but reduced baseflows have become more common in recent years. Based on this, the planning team felt that natural barriers will be severe most years where they exist, but are mostly reversible, resulting in an overall pressure rating of Low.\n\n\n\n\nDFO. 1991.

    "section": "Connectivity Status Assessment",
    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment\nThe planning team identified two Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed for each focal species – Accessible Key Habitat and Accessible Overwintering Habitat (Table 1). KEAs are the key aspects of anadromous salmon habitat that are being targeted by this WCRP. For each KEA, an associated indicator was assigned to measure the status of that KEA. The connectivity status indicators were used to establish goals to improve key habitat connectivity over time and is the baseline against which progress is tracked over time.\nThe current connectivity status was estimated using three spatial models:\n\nAccessibility model: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would naturally limit upstream movement (Table 1).\nHabitat model: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat, i.e., habitat likely to support spawning or rearing, rather than simply movement corridors. The habitat model identifies areas within waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in Appendix C.\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). Key habitat with no structures or only passable structures downstream was considered connected. Key habitat upstream of full, partial, or potential barriers was considered disconnected. All connected habitat was summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to arrive at the KEA indicators. Detailed methods for the connectivity model can be found in Appendix C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Connectivity status assessment for spawning (a) and rearing (b) habitat in the Bulkley River watershed. The two KEAs - Accessible Spawning Habitat and Accessible Rearing Habitat - are evaluated by dividing the length of linear habitat (of each type) that is currently connected to focal species by the total length of all linear habitat (of each type) in the watershed.\n\n\nFocal Species\nKEA\nIndicator\nPoor\nFair\nGood\nVery Good\n\n\n\n\nAndromous Salmon\nAvailable Habitat\n% of total linear habitat\n&lt;80%\n-\n81-90%\n&gt;90%\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Status:\n\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments: Indicator rating definitions are based on the consensus decisions of the planning team, including the decision not to define Fair.

This process, combined with input from local knowledge holders and experts, is used to develop field plans for assessing structures that have the potential to block the most key habitat in the watershed. Field assessments are based on the B.C. Fish Passage Strategic Approach Environment (2014) and can include a barrier assessment (i.e., evaluating passability of the structure), a habitat confirmation (i.e., evaluation of whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species and whether there are other undocumented man-made or natural barriers upstream or downstream), or a detailed habitat investigation (e.g., a fish passage study or further in-depth analysis of habitat features in a waterbody).\nThe ranking process accounts for the long-term and immediate habitat gains potentially offered by each structure to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) are ranked in each iteration of the ranking process. Details of the ranking process used to guide field assessments can be found in Appendix C."

Depending on the barrier, owner, financial constraints, and quality of upstream habitat, the action may be to leave to end of life cycle before reviewing again, remove and decommission the structure, replace with a new passable structure, or modify to temporarily restore connectivity (e.g., fish ladder or baffles installed; (Table 2)).\nAssessed structures that remain data deficient list – some form of field assessment has been completed on the structure, but further investigation is required to confirm either the passability status or presence/suitability of upstream habitat (Table 3).\nRehabilitated barriers list – priority barriers that have been addressed either through removal, replacement, or temporary fish passage improvement projects; (Table 4).\nNon-actionable barriers list – the structure is confirmed to be a barrier to fish passage and have some amount/quality of habitat upstream, but the planning team will not identify actions to advance rehabilitation of the structure because of logistic considerations (e.g., financial costs), short habitat gain, or the upstream habitat is of poor quality or unsuitable in its present condition to support key life stages of the focal species Appendix C.\nExcluded structures list – the structure is excluded from further consideration in subsequent ranking and work planning because the structure is confirmed passable, not present, or there is no key habitat upstream Appendix C.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  The Horsefly River watershed priority barrier list, which includes\nbarriers that have undergone field assessment, been reviewed by the\nplanning team, and selected to pursue for proactive rehabilitation.

Tolko Industries Ltd. has completed barrier rehabilitation on 126511 Tributary to Horsefly River and 126594 Niquidet Creek, with further plans to rehabilitate crossings on 57298 Boscar Creek and 57158 McKinley Creek in the near future. CWF continues to work with the B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to try to advance rehabilitation designs for Vedder and Wilmot creeks. CWF attended the 2023 Horsefly Salmon Festival, where they shared an interactive art display to communicate the fish passage efforts in the watershed. Other program partners were also in attendance to educate the public about various aspects of salmon and conservation taking place in the watershed. The Williams Lake First Nation worked with the B.C. Ministry of Forests to review and identify potential barriers for rehabilitation in the upper portions of the Horsefly River watershed, with some tentative sites for rehabilitation identified that are currently being explored."

The Theories of Change are results-oriented and clearly define the expected outcome.

    "section": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods",
    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Horsefly River watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the B.C. Fish Passage Technical Working Group, resulting in a flexible, customizable open-source spatial model called “bcfishpass”. The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for focal species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to focal species. The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. (2009) for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each focal species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species are summarized in Table 15. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type and represents a linear measure of potential habitat. To recognize the rearing value provided by features represented by polygons for certain species (e.g., wetlands for Coho Salmon and lakes for Sockeye Salmon) a multiplier of 1.5x the length of the stream segments flowing through the polygons was applied.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Parameters and thresholds used to inform the Intrinsic Potential\nhabitat model for spawning and rearing habitat for each focal species in\nthe Horsefly River watershed.
