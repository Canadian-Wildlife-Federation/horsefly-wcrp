Tolko Industries Ltd. has completed barrier rehabilitation on 126511 Tributary to Horsefly River and 126594 Niquidet Creek, with further plans to rehabilitate crossings on 57298 Boscar Creek and 57158 McKinley Creek in the near future. CWF continues to work with the BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to try to advance rehabilitation designs for Vedder and Wilmot creeks. CWF attended the 2023 Horsefly Salmon Festival, where they shared an interactive art display to communicate the fish passage efforts in the watershed. Other program partners were also in attendance to educate the public about various aspects of salmon and conservation taking place in the watershed. The Williams Lake First Nation worked with the BC Ministry of Forests to review and identify potential barriers for rehabilitation in the upper portions of the Horsefly River watershed, with some tentative sites for rehabilitation identified that are currently being explored."

The planning team identified five broad strategies to implement through this WCRP, 1) crossing remediation, 2) lateral barrier remediation, 3) dam remediation, 4) barrier prevention, and 5) communication and education. Individual actions were qualitatively evaluated based on the anticipated effect each action will have on realizing on-the-ground gains in connectivity. Effectiveness ratings are based on a combination of “Feasibility and”Impact”, Feasibility is defined as the degree to which the project team can implement the action within realistic constraints (financial, time, ethical, etc.) and Impact is the degree to which the action is likely to contribute to achieving one or more of the goals established in this plan."

Primarily for crossings linked to highway infrastructure.Community Salmon ProgramFor projects supporting the protection, conservation and enhancement or rehabilitation of Pacific salmonids and their habitat. Funding for volunteer and not-for-profit community-based groups. Applicant must have a significant volunteer component to their group and to the project. Requires 50% match for funding (volunteer, in-kind, donation or other grants). Southern Boundary Restoration and Enhancement FundSupports 3 activities: (1) develop improved information for resource management; (2) Rehabilitate and restore marine and freshwater habitat; and (3) enhance wild stock production through low technology techniques. Emphasis for funding is on stocks of conservation concern, particularly those contributing to a fishery and stocks of bilateral fishery relevance.Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation Enhancement and Restoration GrantsProjects that focus on freshwater wild fish, native wildlife species and their habitats, have the potential to achieve a significant conservation outcome, while maintaining or enhancing opportunities for fishing, hunting, trapping, wildlife viewing and associated outdoor recreational activities. Primary focus is on provincially managed fisheries such as Steelhead and Westslope Cutthroat Trout. Requires 50% funding match.Environmental Damages FundDirect funds received from fines, court orders and voluntary payments to priority projects that will benefit Canada’s natural environment, under 4 categories of improvement (in order of preference): (1) restoration, (2) environmental quality improvement, (3) research and development, and (4) education and awareness.Habitat Stewardship Program for Aquatic Species at RiskProgram for non-profits, Indigenous governments, academic institutions for activities that align with recovery actions identified in SARA recovery documents and/or COSEWIC assessment documents. Project must address one or more of 3 broad categories: (1) Important habitat for aquatic species at risk is improved and/or managed to meet their recovery needs; (2) Threats to aquatic species at risk and/or their habitat are stopped, removed, and/or mitigated; (3) Collaboration and partnerships support the conservation and recovery of aquatic species at risk. Limited to at-risk species listed under COSEWIC and/or SARA as threatened, endangered or special concern. Canada Nature Fund for Aquatic Species at RiskFunding program aimed at addressing priority threats for aquatic species at risk listed as endangered, threatened or Special Concern by COSEWIC, as they align with existing federal, provincial or other local recovery plans. Limited to species in the Columbia and Fraser basins in BC, among other priority areas across Canada. Focus on multi-year, multi-partner initiatives that apply an ecosystem or multi-species approach and create a legacy by enabling recovery actions that carry beyond the life of the funding program. Amounts from $100K-$1M available per year.BC Salmon Restoration and Innovation FundFunding for Indigenous enterprises, academia, industry associations, stewardship groups and commercial groups to support initiatives that support the protection and restoration of wild Pacific salmon and other BC fish stocks or ensure fish and seafood sector in BC is environmentally and economically sustainable. Five main priorities including species of concern rebuilding through habitat restoration with priority for projects that are part of a watershed-scale restoration plan/prioritization effort; build on successful previous restoration efforts; focus on critical habitat and/or the rehabilitation of natural ecosystem processes.Aboriginal Fund for Species at RiskProgram for Indigenous groups for activities that align with recovery actions identified in SARA recovery documents and/or COSEWIC assessment documents for species listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern by SARA or COSEWIC. Project must address one or more of 4 broad categories: (1) Habitat for species at risk is improved and/or managed to meet their recovery needs; (2) Threats to species at risk and/or their habitat are stopped, removed and/or mitigated; (3) Collaboration, information sharing and partnership between Indigenous communities, governments and organizations and other interested parties (e.g. federal/provincial/territorial governments, academia, industry, private sector) is enhanced; and (4) Capacity within Indigenous communities, to lead in the stewardship of species at risk and contribute to broader SARA implementation, is strengthened. Federal Gas Tax Fund - Community Works FundFunding available to local governments from federal gas tax, with funds to be allocated for a variety of municipal projects/initiatives, including local roads/bridges and disaster mitigation.Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation FundFor those projects where flood risk is high: Funding available to local, regional and provincial governments, private sector, non-profit organizations, and Indigenous groups for projects aimed at reducing the socio-economic, environmental and cultural impacts triggered by natural hazards and extreme weather events and taking into consideration current and future impacts of climate change in communities and infrastructure at high risk. Includes both new construction of public infrastructure and modification/reinforcement of existing infrastructure. Projects must have a minimum of $20 M in eligible expenditures and can be bundled together.Community Gaming GrantsFunding for non-profit organizations (check funding program guidelines for specific eligibility requirements) for programs that help to protect and improve the environment by: (1) Conserving or revitalizing local ecosystems, (2) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, (3) Providing community education or engagement opportunities related to the environment and agriculture or (4) Supporting the welfare of domestic animals and/or wildlife. Grants range from $100K-250K per year.Sitka FoundationFunding for registered charities, universities, and government agencies (qualified Canadian organizations) for projects related to coastline and watershed conservation and climate change in 4 key areas: (1) land, water, and ocean conservation, (2) scientific research for nature and the environment, (3)  public engagement around the importance of a healthy environment, (4) innovative conservation efforts in Canadian communities, at the local, provincial, and federal levelsTULA FoundationSupports various environmental programs of interest to the Foundation on a case-by-case basis.Vancouver FoundationGranting agency for community, social and environmental initiatives for qualified Canadian organizations (charitable organizations, universities, government agencies). Granting programs change on an annual basis.BC Conservation Foundation Small Project FundFunding available to Non-profits, fish and wildlife clubs (sportsmen’s associations), businesses, local/regional governments, public organizations and First Nations for projects with demonstrated positive impact for fish, wildlife and habitat, including outreach programs. Preference given to projects where BCCF is not the sole funder.Real Estate Foundation of BC General GrantsFunding for First Nations, charities and societies, non-governmental organizations, universities and colleges, trade associations, local and regional governments, and social enterprises registered as C3s for sustainable land use and real estate practices in BC. Funds up to 50% of cash portion of a project."

    "text": "Connectivity Status Assessment Methods\nThe connectivity status assessment for anadromous salmonids in the Horsefly River watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the BC Fish Passage Technical Working Group, resulting in a flexible, customizable open-source spatial model called “bcfishpass”. The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for target species, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible to target species. The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see Sheer et al. 2009 for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for each target species. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for each species based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat for each target species are summarized in Table 15. The quantity of modelled habitat for each species was aggregated for each habitat type and represents a linear measure of potential habitat. To recognize the rearing value provided by features represented by polygons for certain species (e.g., wetlands for Coho Salmon and lakes for Sockeye Salmon) a multiplier of 1.5x the length of the stream segments flowing through the polygons was applied.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Additional Key Actors in the Horsefly River watershed. Key Actors are\nthe individuals, groups, and/or organizations, outside of the planning\nteam, with influence and relevant experience in the watershed, whose\nengagement will be critical for the successful implementation of this\nWCRP.
